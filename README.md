# Conway's Game of Life

## Problem Description
In this program, I need to write Game of Life with the most beautiful code that I can write, with the details as:
1. The problem statement can be found on Wikipedia (Keyword: Conway's Game of Life)
2. Use Java as the language
3. Write the most beautiful code as possible
4. The format of input and output is up to you
5. Infinite grid is possible, array out of bound exception is possible
7. You need to keep it only in your local Git

### Game of Life Rules

And the rules of Game of Life are:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These rules can be concluded as:
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All others live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
